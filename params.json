NFC comes for help. \r\n\r\nFirst you need to buy a NFC tag online, it's pretty cheap, and there are plenty online retailers out there, just grab some.\r\n\r\nSecond, install this app on your mobile phone, launch it. Input your website url in the edit field, and click `Confirm'.\r\n\r\nFinally, place the NFC tag you've bought to your NFC part of your NFC powered devices, and wait for the write process to be done.\r\n\r\nOnce you've finished the 3 steps, congratulations, now you own the NFC tag that can bring up your website on any NFC powered devices, easy, right?\r\n\r\n## About the code\r\nThis project is just a hobby project, the code of which is not quite clean and neat, so help me out here. But the project do show the basic code for detect, read & write of NFC tags on android devices. \r\n\r\nThe project is still at the early stage, and more functionality will be added. Join me if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\n\r\nSpecials thanks to the NDEF tools project hosted on google code. [The Project](http://code.google.com/p/ndef-tools-for-android) can be found here.\r\n\r\nThis project provides the best NFC practices, such as how to detect a tag, how to read & write the tag, as well as the exception handling stuff. Just go ahead and read the f-word code, you'll get pretty much what you need to get start with NFC programming on android.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
